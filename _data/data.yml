    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I have been fortunate enough to have had a wide variety of both academic and work related experiences. I enjoy getting to know new groups of people and helping unpack the root of their business issue. Combine that with a broad and technical background I’m often relied upon to be a translator or integrator. As my career has primarily been consultative in nature it has allowed me to gain a great appreciation of various work environments and business problems. I have a natural thirst for knowledge and I really enjoy applying my experiences to new problems and areas of the industry.

      As a consultant residing in Regina it is no surprise my engagements have been almost exclusively Government and Crown related. I know that my familiarity with Government processes and policy has served me well and accelerated my ability to work within these organizational structures.
      
      I continue to focus on a strategy whose goal is to synchronize information technology (IT) and business cultures/objectives. I measure my success as a reflection of how well IT is being absorbed as a function of business.
